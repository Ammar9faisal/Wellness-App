The Wellness App (WA) is a mental health and wellness platform designed by students, for students. Our goal is to create a tool that seamlessly fits into the busy lives of students, allowing them to improve their mental health, build better habits, and achieve personal wellness goals with minimal effort. Recognizing that students often have limited time between classes, we designed the app to be easily accessible on laptops, iPads, and other devices as a web application, ensuring convenience and broad accessibility.

WA provides a comprehensive platform for students to track their daily emotions, habits, and progress through features such as a daily journal, habit tracker, goal setting, and personalized recommendations. Additionally, the app offers educational resources, an AI chatbot for support, and access to local mental health resources tailored to student needs.

The system is primarily designed for students who want to enhance their mental well-being while balancing academic and personal responsibilities. Users can log their daily experiences, track emotional states, and monitor progress toward personal goals with minimal effort. To keep students engaged and motivated, the app includes motivational content such as affirmations, quotes, and interactive challenges.

WA also serves as a resource hub, providing access to blog posts, educational content, and a directory of local student support services. The AI chatbot will offer immediate, personalized support, answering questions and providing guidance based on the user’s needs.

To ensure a personalized experience, the app includes a sign-up questionnaire to gather initial user preferences and goals. The user profile will dynamically update based on interactions, ensuring that recommendations and content remain relevant. Users can customize their experience by enabling reminders and notifications or opting for a more minimalistic interface. A disclaimer page will ensure users understand the app’s limitations and encourage them to seek professional help when necessary.

Unlike many existing mental health and wellness tools that lack personalization and accessibility for students, WA is built with their unique needs in mind. As a web application, it removes barriers to entry, making it available anytime and anywhere without requiring downloads or installations. Future updates may include additional features such as student community forums or integration with wearable devices for enhanced tracking.

This project will be considered successful if students report improved mental health, increased engagement with the app’s features, and a high level of satisfaction with its accessibility and personalization. Success will also be measured by a reduction in student-reported stress levels and an increase in the achievement of personal wellness goals. By developing this app in-house, we ensure that it remains cost-effective, adaptable to user feedback, and truly built for students, by students.
