Our wellness app, Eunoia Hub, is an application for well-being and mental health created for and by students.
Our objective is to provide a tool that easily integrates within students' hectic schedules so they can attain
their own personal wellness objectives, develop healthier behaviours, and enhance their mental health with little effort.
Since students frequently have little time between sessions, we made the program conveniently and readily available as a web
application on laptops, iPads, and other devices, guaranteeing ease and wide accessibility.

With tools including a daily journal, habit tracker, goal setting, and tailored suggestions, Eunoia offers students an 
extensive tool to monitor their everyday feelings, routines, and development.
The application also provides a variety of local mental health resources that are suited to the requirements of students, 
educational materials, and an AI chatbot for assistance.

The approach is mainly intended for students that wish to balance overall personal and academic obligations while improving 
their state of mind.   
With little effort, users can record their everyday events, keep tabs on their state of mind, and assess how they're doing 
towards individual objectives. 
The application contains inspirational quotations, affirmations, and interactive activities to maintain young people 
interested and inspired.

A database of local student support services, blog entries, and instructional materials are all accessible through Eunoia, 
which also acts as a reference centre. 
According to the user's demands, the AI chatbot will provide prompt, individualized assistance by responding to inquiries 
and offering advice.

The application offers a sign-up questionnaire to collect information on how users deal with certain situations in order to 
provide a tailored experience. 
In order to keep suggestions and material current, the user profile will be updated constantly in response to engagements.   
By turning on alerts and reminders or choosing a simpler design, users may personalize their experience. 
Users will be made aware of the app's limits and encouraged to seek professional assistance when needed thanks to a disclaimer 
page.

The work will be deemed successful when users express greater contentment about the app's accessibility and customisation, 
enhanced engagement using its functions, and better mental wellness.  
Lower stress levels as indicated by students and higher attainment of individual wellness objectives will also be used as 
indicators of success. 
Making this software in-house guarantees that it will continue to be affordable, responsive to user input, and genuinely 
created for students, by students.
